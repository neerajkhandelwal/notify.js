notify.js requires latest jQuery. It is a very simple plugin to use and in return it creates a notification box.

Syntax:
	$('.myclass').notify('my message here', {'optional':'css'});

If there is some error in the message, it can be viewed in console. Second argument should be Array and should have supported css properties in jQuery.
