	Third argument is an optional array with defined keys delay, fadein and fadeout, in the same order.

	Delay is the time for notification display, fadein is the time for full appearance of notification and fadeout is the time for notification to vanish after delay. All the values are in millisecond.

If there is some error in the message, it can be viewed in console. Second argument should be Array and should have supported css properties in jQuery. Please see the example.html for example and do not forget to include the jquery-latest as jquery.js.
